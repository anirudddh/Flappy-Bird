To play the game: https://anirudddh.github.io/Flappy-Bird/

Flappy Bird is a side-scrolling game featuring 2D retro style graphics. 
The objective is to direct a flying bird, who moves continuously to the right, between sets of Mario-like pipes. 
If the player touches the pipes, they lose. The bird briefly flaps upward each time that the player presses a key; if a key is not pressed, the bird falls because of gravity; each pair of pipes that he navigates between earns the player a single point.

Enjoy! :)
